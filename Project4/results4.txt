Knapsack Branch and Bound:
The branch and bound algorithm for the knapsack problem runs faster than the
exhaustive search, but not nearly as fast as the greedy algorithm or the ILP
solver for the knapsack problem. The algorithm seems to run in exponential time
which is far worse than the greedy algorithm but better than the exhaustive
search.  The results produced by the branch and bound algorithm are nearly as
good as the ILP solver, a llittle bit better than the greedy algorithm, and
much better than the exhaustive algorithm at higher values (at lower values,
they gave equal results, as both found the best answer). The branch and bound
algorithm was able to produce the same results as the ILP solver at low values,
because both found the optimal solution, but results were not quite as good at
higher values. Overall, it produced optimal solutions when it had enough time
(for smaller problems), and very close to optimal solutions when it ran out of
time (for larger problems).
